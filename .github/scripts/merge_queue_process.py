"""
Merge Queue Processor
---------------------
Scheduled processor that advances the merge queue each cycle.

For each queue, finds the head PR (oldest ``enqueued_at``).  A PR is
only processed when it is at the front of **all** queues it belongs to.

Processing steps for an eligible PR:
1. Transition from ``mq:queued`` → ``mq:active``
2. Update PR branch (merge develop into it)
3. Wait for CI on the next cycle
4. On CI success → squash-merge
5. On CI failure → eject from all queues

Environment variables (set by the workflow):
    GH_TOKEN – GitHub API token
    REPO     – owner/repo
